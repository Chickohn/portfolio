The game is set within our solar system, with the player navigating a spaceship to defend Earth and other planets from an onslaught of meteors. The first level begins with the player in orbit around Earth, tasked with saving the planet from an approaching meteor shower. Upon successful defense, the player advances to subsequent levels, exploring other celestial bodies like Mars."

          "content": "To manage the complexity of enemy behavior, I implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) for AI decision-making. FSMs are a proven method in game development, offering simplicity and efficiency while allowing for robust control over state transitions. In this system, the enemy AI can only occupy one state at a time, such as patrolling or attacking, and transitions are triggered by specific in-game events, such as spotting the player or taking damage."
